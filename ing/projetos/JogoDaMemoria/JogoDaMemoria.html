    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Memory Game is an interactive game where players need to find pairs of matching cards. It is designed to be educational and fun, helping to improve players' memory.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>To start the game, all cards are placed face down so they cannot be seen and are arranged randomly. Each player, on their turn, must flip over two cards and let everyone see them.</p>
    <p>Then two things can happen:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>If the pair matches</strong>, the player should collect that pair, earning a point, and play again.</li>
      <li><strong>If the pair does not match</strong>, the cards should be turned face down again, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The game ends when all pairs have been found or by clicking the end game button.</p>

    <h1>How to play the game?</h1>
    <p>The game runs directly in the browser. Just open the HTML file in any compatible browser (OR at this <a href="https://guimbreon.online/ITW">link</a>).</p>

    <h2>Information you should know:</h2>
    <p>On the personal page, there is a table with your best times and a shop where you can buy different decks to play with based on the points awarded to each player.</p>
    <p>Points are awarded as the player wins games and depending on the difficulty of each match (game time limit), which is chosen at the start of each game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No limit: 1 Point</li>
      <li>10-minute limit: 2 Points</li>
      <li>7-minute limit: 4 Points</li>
      <li>3-minute limit: 7 Points</li>
      <li>1-minute limit: 10 Points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the beginning of each match, you can also choose the game mode by clicking on its option:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click: Play by clicking on the cards</li>
      <li>Type: Play by typing the IDs of the cards in the text boxes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is also a statistics page where you can see some information about played matches, such as the best global ranking with time and player name, and the best personal ranking with the top 10 times of each player.</p>
